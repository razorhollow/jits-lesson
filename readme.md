#JitsPlanner

## Getting Started

JitsPlanner is a lesson-plan automation app that generates weekly lesson plans from a library of topics. Each week, a new category is cycled through, and 6 techniques are loaded based on a queue. Optional youtube videos accompany each technique, and instructors are presented with an optional modal window with notes for quick reminders and key ideas while teaching.
